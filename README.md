# About

I created a few bots with discord.js and thought having a template would be convenient for me.
No automatic deployments yet as most of my bots are run locally for private servers.
That will be added to the template should I require it in the future, though!
## Included Features 

- [x] Slash commands
- [x] semantic-release for auto tagging
- [ ] Jest for testing
- [ ] Deployment

## Setup

1. Install Node 16 ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) recommended)
2. `npm ci`
3. `cp config.example.json config.json` and update the values
4. `npm run update`
5. `npm start`
